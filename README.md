# Sync
A gateway application that can extract wago plc data and send it to the AWS cloud. You can configure the extraction based on the PLC program. (this works only if the export files are active and uploaded to the controller). 
In sync, you can upload your AWS device certs and connect your things with a selected plc
Sync supports multiple PLCs; the limit is not tested yet!

You need to run Sync on a separate device (Rasberry PI or never Wago PLCs with more memory.)
